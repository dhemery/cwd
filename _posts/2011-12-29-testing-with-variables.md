There are some interesting comments there.

[Elisabeth Hendrickson](http://testobsessed.com/)
and I have created a screencast called "Testing with Variables."

<div style="height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; width: 100%;">
    <iframe style="height: 100%; left: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; width: 100%;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/xcYswvWF20M"></iframe>
</div>

You can find it in two places:

 - [On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcYswvWF20M&feature=youtu.be)
 - [On Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/34356209)

This is our first screencast and we would love feedback.
