<p> As an exercise in clarifying my thoughts, I created definitions for the words <em>lead</em> and <em>leadership</em>: </p>
<dl>
<dt>
<a>
<strong>lead</strong>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>
<em>v.</em>  To influence people to freely serve a shared purpose.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt>
<a>
<strong>leadership</strong>
</a>
</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>
<em>n.</em>  The process of influencing people to freely serve a shared purpose.  (The process of leading.)</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p> How well does this definition fit your idea of leadership?  What's your definition? </p>
<p> [Update July 15:  Shortened "ongoing process" to "process."  I think the word process implies ongoing.] </p>
