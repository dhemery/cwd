One of the most powerful things you can do to help someone solve a problem is to ask great questions. My new article "<a href="http://dhemery.com/pdf/questions_to_explore_problems.pdf">Questions to Explore Problems</a>" (PDF) gives dozens of questions that Iâ€™ve found essential in my work as a coach, including questions to explore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem in general.</li>
<li>The desired state, the perceived state, and the difference between the two.</li>
<li>The way the problem is stated.</li>
<li>The problem's past, present, and future.</li>
<li>The way the problem is being solved.</li>
<li>The way you are exploring the problem.</li>
</ul>
