<p>Here's a new game I've invented, called <strong>
<em>The Resistance as a Resource Game.</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Objective.</strong>  To create, learn, remember, and express ideas about how to respond to resistance.</p>
<p>
<strong>Where to Play.</strong>  The game can be played anywhere that ideas can be posted, such as mailing lists, electronic forums, and conference rooms with walls, white boards, or flip charts.</p>
<p>
<strong>Players.</strong>  Any number of players can play.</p>
<p>
<strong>Turns.</strong>  It is always your turn.</p>
<p>
<strong>Moves.</strong>  There are four kinds of moves:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Change.</strong>
<em>Post an example of change that you are promoting.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>"Resistance."</strong>  Choose one of the posted examples of change, and <em>post an example of a statement that expresses "resistance" to that change.</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Reason.</strong>  Choose one of the posted examples of "resistance," and <em>post an example of a reason that an intelligent, competent, sincere person of good will might say such a thing.</em>  My article "<a href="http://dhemery.com/articles/resistance_as_a_resource/">Resistance as a Resource</a>" might give you ideas for this move.</li>
<li>
<strong>Response.</strong>  Choose one of the posted reasons, and <em>post an idea about how to respond effectively to someone who has that reason for making that statement.</em>
</li>
</ol>
